# Instagram Data Analysis
This project is about using [Panoply](https://panoply.io) as an ETL tool to explore [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) data for marketing use (i.e. promotion, segmentation and etc.). 


## Introduction  
This project is built on top of the data challenge that Panoply has released. Panoply is a cloud data warehouse that you could gather data from different data sources (i.e. AWS S3, Google analytics and etc.) easily into one place and then connect to different Business Intelligence tools (i.e. Chartio, Mode and etc.) for analytics and insights.    

Panoply has recently integrated their data warehouse with [Instagram API](https://blog.panoply.io/instagram-on-panoply) to collect data. This [challenge](https://blog.panoply.io/instagram-data-challenge) is about using Panoply as an ETL tool to explore Instagram data for marketing use (i.e. promotion, segmentation and etc.). 

I want to use SQL for data analytics, Panoply for data warehouse and [Mode](https://mode.com/) for BI visualization tool.

## Project Design
1. Explore Panoply, using resources it provided for the challenge and documentations on its own website.    
2. Create Panoply free trial account, connect to provided data source, connect to BI tool.  
3. Explore the datasets, understand the schemas and relationships.  
4. Research and come up with questions/KPI that an Instagram owner would like to track and have them answered. So they could get insights to grow their brand.  
5. Lastly, use Mode to build visualizations and submit to the challenge.
